// Package viewstate allows to manage current active view number. It
// provides means for obtaining the current active view number, as
// well as to coordinate the process of changing its value according
// to the view-change mechanism.
//
// There are two main values that represent the state of the view:
// 'current' and 'expected' view numbers. The values initially equal
// to zero and can only monotonically increase. The current view is
// active if current and expected view numbers match.

// State defines operations on view state. All methods are safe to
// invoke concurrently.
//
// HoldView method returns current and expected view numbers and
// defers view change. The returned values will denote the actual view
// state until the returned release function is invoked.
//
// AdvanceExpectedView method synchronizes beginning of view change.
// If the supplied view number is greater than the expected view
// number then the latter is increased to match the supplied one. It
// returns true if the expected view number was updated. In that case,
// the current and expected view numbers will remain the same until
// the returned release function is invoked.
//
// AdvanceCurrentView method synchronizes transition into a new view.
// If the supplied value is greater than the current view number then
// the latter is increased to match the supplied one. The return value
// "ok" indicates if the current view number was updated. In that
// case, the current and expected view numbers will remain the same
// until the returned release function is invoked. The return value
// "active" indicates if the current and expected view numbers match,
// i.e. the current view has become active.
